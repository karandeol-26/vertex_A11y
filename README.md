# Vertex A11y

A premium Chrome extension that scans web pages for accessibility issues and provides actionable insights to help developers build more inclusive websites.

## The Problem

Web accessibility remains a critical challenge in modern web development. Studies show that **over 96% of websites fail to meet basic accessibility standards**, creating barriers for the millions of users who rely on assistive technologies. This widespread non-compliance excludes people with disabilities from accessing essential digital services, information, and opportunities.

Common accessibility issues include:
- Missing alt text on images
- Poor color contrast ratios
- Lack of keyboard navigation support
- Missing form labels
- Improper semantic HTML structure
- Inadequate focus management

## The Solution

By integrating accessibility testing directly into the development workflow, we make it easier for teams to catch and fix problems before they reach production.
